The app must allow a user to register by requesting at least their email address, username,
last name, first name, and a password that is somehow protected. After registration, an
email with a unique link must be sent to the registered user to verify their account.
The user must be able to login using their username and password, and also receive
an email allowing them to reset their password if they forget it. Additionally, the user
must be able to log out with just one click from any page on the site.
